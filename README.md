# Micro Machines Competition
Master System Micro Machines competition play hack

This is a patch to the Master System version of Micro Machines, to provide facilities useful for competition play. Current features:

* Fast boot to track selection
* Select any track (excluding those not working in 2-player mode)
* Skip player (and handicap) selection
* Skip results screen

Things that might be nice in future, but rather more work:

* Competition bracket running, similar to later iterations of the game (enter names, run a tournament, show results at the end)
* Time trial mode (single car, timed laps)
